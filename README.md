# CDR (Clojure Development REPL)

A Clojure/ClojureScript IDE completely in the browser. One of the difficulty in getting started with Clojure/LISP
programming is the tooling. The goal of CDR is to make Clojure development simple and easy for newbies and expert 
alike.


CDR integrates with git hosted on github or bitbucket.  CDR uses parainfer with CodeMirror for structural editing.
The only dependency is a web browser like Chrome and FireFox.
